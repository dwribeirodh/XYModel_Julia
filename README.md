# XYModel_Julia
This package applies the Metropolis algorithm to generate thermodynamic data and equilibrium configurations of the [1D XY model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_XY_model). Magnetization, internal energy, and specific heat can be computed by running a Monte Carlo simulation with adjustable parameters.
